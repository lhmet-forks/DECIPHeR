# DECIPHeR  Dynamic fluxEs and ConnectIvity for Predictions of HydRology
DECIPHeR is a flexible modelling framework for hydrologic simulation and prediction from catchment to continental scales.  The model can be adapted for specific hydrologic settings or data availability altering the representation of spatial heterogeneity, spatial connectivity and hydrological processes in the landscape.  The model has an automated build and is computationally efficient to run large ensembles and, crucially, characterises model uncertainty. 
### Code Availability
The code is available through this GitHub Repository (https://github.com/uob-hydrology/DECIPHeR).  If you have any questions about using or running the code then please contact gemma.coxon@bristol.ac.uk
### Documentation
DECIPHeR has been documented in an open access paper which is soon to be submitted to Geoscientific Model Development.  A user manual is also provided in the repository to help researchers and/or practitioners to use the model.
